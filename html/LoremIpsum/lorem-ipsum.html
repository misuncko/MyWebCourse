            <h2>Lo<span>r</span>em ipsum began as scrambled, nonsensical Latin derived from Cicero's 1st-century BC text De Finibus
                Bonorum et Malorum.</h2>
            <p>
                Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin,
                though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious
                reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why
                at a glance it looks pretty real.”

            </p>
            <p class="two">
                As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”

            </p>
            <p>
                The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”,
                looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.

                Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source
                behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by
                consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a
                passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C.
                text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.

            <h2>Creation timelines for the standard lorem ipsum passage vary, with some citing the 15th century and
                others the 20th.</h2>
            <p>
                So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter
                likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various
                fonts for a type specimen book.

            </p>
            <p class="two">
                It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in
                the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old
                metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of
                Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.

                And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were hiring
                classics scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version in
                use far before the age of Letraset.
